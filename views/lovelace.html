    <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
    <p>
      Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (Byron; 10 December 1815 â€“ 27
      November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for
      her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose
      computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the
      machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published
      the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a
      result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
