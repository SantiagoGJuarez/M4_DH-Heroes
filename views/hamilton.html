      Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936) is an American computer
      scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. She was director of the
      Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which
      developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program. She later
      founded two software companiesâ€”Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton
      Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hamilton has
      published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty
      projects and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with
      coining the term "software engineering".[1] On November 22, 2016, Hamilton
      received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from president Barack Obama for
      her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's
      Apollo Moon missions.
